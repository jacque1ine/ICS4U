    Ways to deal with asynchornous data 
    this is when something is going on but you don't want to wait for that thing to be done
    to continue your program. You want to continue your program while it is happening. 
    Synchoronous programming is where something happens and you wait until it is complepletely finished
    before your move on. 
    Async can be useful when you are getting data from somehwere and it takes awhile and you 
    don't want the rest of your program to stall and wait

    Promises - 

    Async await -
